Our Name
All at last return to the sea—to Oceanus, the ocean river, like the ever-flowing stream of time, the beginning and the end. –Rachel Carson, The Sea Around Us
All round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream of the river Oceanus. –Hephaistos creating Achilles’ shield in Homer’s the Iliad Book XVIII
“Ocean river” is a term used by Homer and Rachel Carson, among others, to describe the connectedness of the natural world. It symbolizes the folly in attempting to separate ocean, river and watershed, which truly are linked as one. We believe in a more inclusive and holistic perspective in environmental conservation. To draw boundaries among ecosystems is not the way of the salmon, the eel, otter or osprey. Instead, we all must recognize the permeability of natural boundaries, as Carson did. ORI believes that we must follow Carson’s lead to understand the complex relationships among oceans, shores, rivers and watersheds, and make environmental decisions based on this greater understanding.",https://facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/oceanriverinstitute/,https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/OceanRiverRob,https://youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/user/1OceanRiverRob,,https://linkedin.com/company/Ocean River Institute,oceanriverrob

The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation is a nonprofit charity dedicated to planting edible, fruitful trees and plants to benefit the environment and all its inhabitants. Our primary mission is to plant and help others plant a collective total of 18 billion fruit trees across the world (approximately 3 for every person alive) and encourage their growth under organic standards.
FTPF provides support, resources, and guidance for those interested in planting fruit trees and spearheads a variety of planting programs. These programs are aimed at enriching the environment, providing nutritious food sources for wild and rescued animals, and improving human health by bringing delicious, fresh, locally grown raw fruits and vegetables of the highest quality into the lives of all people.
VISION
We envision a place where one can have a summer picnic under the shade of a fruit tree, breathe the clean air it generates, and not have to bring anything other than an appetite for the healthy fruits growing overhead. A world where one can take a walk in the park during a lunch break, pick and eat a variety of delicious fruits, plant the seeds so others can eventually do the same and provide an alternative to buying environmentally-destructive, illness-causing, chemically-laden products.
Simply put, our goal is to encourage and inspire the planting of 18 billion fruit trees around the world. 18 billion fruit trees can spring out of the soul of one human being — we believe in thinking big, and loving even more.",https://facebook.com/fruittreeplantingfoundation,https://twitter.com/FTPFdotorg,https://youtube.com/user/upzirons,https://instagram.com/fruittreeplantingfoundation,https://linkedin.com/company/company/the-fruit-tree-planting-foundation,ftpfdotorg
