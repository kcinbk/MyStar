Civil-rights lawsuits are a key tool for holding public servants accountable. Over the last 50 years, however, courts have developed a number of doctrines to prevent people injured by the government from vindicating their rights. The net result of these doctrines is that public officials are freer than ever to ignore limitations on their power and run roughshod over the rights of individuals, especially those belonging to racial, gender, sexual orientation, and other minorities. There is thus a need for strategic, coordinated, well-executed litigation to limit these doctrines’ reach.
Public Accountability aims to fill that need.",https://facebook.com/pubaccountability,https://twitter.com/Public_Acct,,https://instagram.com/public.accountability,https://linkedin.com/company/public-accountability
